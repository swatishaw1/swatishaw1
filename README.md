# Hi — I’m Swati Shaw
**Full-Stack Developer | Backend-Focused | CS Student**

I build real-world web applications with clean architecture, strong backend logic, and production-style workflows.  
My primary interest is backend development — designing APIs, managing data flow, integrating external services, and building systems that behave like real production applications.

---

## About

I started with core Java and gradually moved into full-stack development using **Spring Boot and React**.  
Instead of building basic demo apps, I focus on projects that simulate **real system behavior** — authentication flows, third-party integrations, background processing, and deployment.


I value:
- readable backend code  
- clear separation of layers  
- reliable API design  
- understanding how real products are built

## ⚡ How I Work

- I focus on correctness before aesthetics  
- Backend logic comes first  
- Small, meaningful commits  
- Clean controller → service → repository structure  
- Debug until the root cause is clear  
- Prefer understanding systems over copying solutions
